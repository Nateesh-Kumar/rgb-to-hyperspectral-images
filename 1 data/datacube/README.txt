Dataset Usage: HSIDermoscopy
This project utilizes the HSIDermoscopy dataset introduced in:

Gu, Yanyang; Partridge, Yi-Ping; Zhou, Jun. A Hyperspectral Dermoscopy Dataset for Melanoma Detection. In: OR 2.0 Context-Aware Operating Theaters, Computer Assisted Robotic Endoscopy, Clinical Image-Based Procedures, and Skin Image Analysis, Springer, 2018, pp. 268â€“276.

Purpose of Use
The corrected data cube from this dataset was used to fine-tune a hyperspectral image synthesis and skin lesion classification model. These hyperspectral images served as ground truth references for enhancing model performance on melanoma and other skin cancers.
