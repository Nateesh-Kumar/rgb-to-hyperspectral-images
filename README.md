# rgb-to-hyperspectral images for skin cancer classification

#abstract
 This work presents a comprehensive approach to enhancing skin cancer diagnosis using hyper
spectral imaging (HSI) generated from RGB images through the fine-tuning of MST++ (Multi
Stage Spectral Transformer++), a state-of-the-art deep learning model originally developed for
 HSI reconstruction. MST++ combines spectral self-attention with convolutional operations in a
 multi-stage encoder-decoder architecture, effectively capturing both spectral and spatial dependen
cies. While the model was initially trained on natural scene data (CAVE dataset), it was fully
 f
 ine-tuned‚Äîwithout freezing any layers‚Äîon a domain-specific dataset consisting of 290 hyper
spectral image cubes derived from skin lesion samples. To match the model‚Äôs 31-band output
 format, the original 16-band HSI data were upsampled, and synthetic RGB images were gener
ated by averaging selected spectral bands. Fine-tuning was conducted using the Mean Squared
 Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer. The updated model was then employed
 to reconstruct 31-band hyperspectral images from 2239 RGB inputs spanning nine skin cancer
 classes. These reconstructed images were subsequently used in classification experiments, with
 an emphasis on identifying discriminative spectral bands. Performance metrics such as accu
racy, precision, recall, F1-score, and statistical significance (p-values) validated the utility of the
 approach. The fully fine-tuned MST++ model enabled high-fidelity hyperspectral reconstruction
 and meaningful spectral analysis, contributing to more accurate and interpretable skin cancer
 classification.

RGB to Hyperspectral Imaging for Skin Cancer Classification
Welcome to the RGB to Hyperspectral Imaging for Skin Cancer Classification project! This repository presents a novel approach to enhance skin cancer detection by converting RGB images to hyperspectral images (HSI) and leveraging advanced machine learning models for classification. Our work achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining fine-tuned hyperspectral conversion models with robust classifiers, focusing on melanoma detection using the HSIDermoscopy dataset.

Project Overview
This project aims to improve skin cancer classification, specifically melanoma detection, by transforming standard RGB dermoscopy images into hyperspectral images (31 bands) and applying machine learning classifiers. We evaluated four hyperspectral conversion models (MST++, AWAN, HRNet, HSCNN+) and four classifiers (2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, SVM, RF). After extensive experimentation, the fine-tuned MST++ model paired with a 2D-CNN classifier achieved the best performance, with detailed metrics on accuracy, p-value, F1 score, and optimal wavelength identification.
Key Contributions

RGB to HSI Conversion: Converted RGB images (3 bands) to hyperspectral images (31 bands) using four models, with MST++ fine-tuned on real HSI datacubes for enhanced accuracy.
Classification: Evaluated four classifiers, identifying 2D-CNN as the most effective for skin cancer classification.
Wavelength Analysis: Identified the best wavelengths for classification, providing insights into spectral features critical for melanoma detection.
Comprehensive Evaluation: Reported accuracy, p-value, and F1 score for robust performance assessment.

Methodology

Dataset: Utilized the HSIDermoscopy dataset for fine-tuning and evaluation.
RGB to HSI Conversion:
Four models (MST++, AWAN, HRNet, HSCNN+) were used to convert RGB images to 31-band HSI.
MST++ was fine-tuned using real HSI datacubes from the HSIDermoscopy dataset to improve conversion accuracy.


Classification:
